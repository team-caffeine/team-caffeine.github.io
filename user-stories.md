### Sandy Brewer | Store Owner
Sandy Brewer owns a local cafe and is looking to expand her operations. She is trying to train her staff, but doesn't have a lot of time on her hands to do it herself. Her current baristas are also overworked and underpaid as it is, so she needs a way to train her staff that is time efficient and engaging. She is hoping that Deja Brew will incorporate custom order functionality as she is looking to market her custom drinks as a market differentiator.
